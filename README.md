# ConjugateNumbers

This was my solution to the following prompt:

A collection of positive integers can be represented by rows of beads in non-increasing order,
each row having the corresponding number of beads. The rows and columns of the resulting
bead representation can then be flipped, to form its conjugate representation.

Write a program in your favorite programming language to obtain the conjugate of a collection of
positive integers.
